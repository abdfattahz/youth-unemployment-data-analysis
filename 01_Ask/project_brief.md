## Project Summary
Youth unemployment is a key issue in Malaysia. This project turns official statistics (2016-2025) into an interactive Google Sheets dashboard to track trends for ages 15-24 and 15-30.

## Problem Statement
Raw tables from DOSM/OpenDOSM are not easy to interpret. Stakeholders need a clear, visual way to see how youth unemployment changed before, during and after COVID-19.

## Goal
- Summarise youth unemployment trends (2016-2025)
- Compare age groups 15-24 vs 15-30
- Highlight pre-COVID, COVID and post-COVID periods
- Present insights in a single, easy-to-use dashboard

## My Role
- Source and validate the dataset
- Prepare and structure data in Google Sheets
- Build pivot tables, charts and KPIs
- Write short insights and recommendations

## Expected Impact
- Faster understanding of long-term youth unemployment trends
- Clear view of COVID-19’s impact and recovery
- Simple starting point for policy, planning, or deeper analysis
